The mimetype for the request is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' instead of 'multipart/form-data' which means that no file contents were transmitted. To fix this error you should provide enctype="multipart/form-data" in your form.

The browser instead transmitted some file names. This was submitted: 'script.js'
